# Hasbro Star Wars Furbacca

Furbacca, the Chewbacca-themed Furby released by Hasbro in 2015, has been discontinued. The companion app, which enhanced the toyâ€™s interactivity, was available from September 3, 2015, to June 29, 2017, and is no longer available for download. Despite its discontinuation, some of its features can still be activated using the Flipper Zero.

Here's how to Activate these features with Flipper Zero

1. Copy wav files into the Flipper Zero microSD card (\wav_player\Furbacca).
2. Open the WAV Player and go to previous folder.
3. Turn on the Furbacca Furby Boom.
4. Select on Flipper an audio and play it.
